# Rhakhis Users Handbook

Guide to Using Rhakhis - the World Flora Online's taxonomic backbone curation tool.

It is currently a work in progress (19-4-2023) and is being added to and ammended as we go. 

If you are looking for the [Concepts Model](https://github.com/rogerhyam/wfo-plant-list-docs/blob/main/docs/concepts.md) this explains the reasons and process behind Rhakhis' functionality rather than how to use the editor.

You will now have Viewer rights. This allows you to navigate the data, view stats and download data.

These are the   

>The [A-Z tab](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/#alpha) you can just start typing the name you are interested in and matching names will be suggested - like looking it up in an index.
>If you want to find a name that you might not be sure of the ending you can use the [Matching tab](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/#match).
>The [Browse tab](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/#browse) allows you to navigate the hierarchy of names and synonyms.
>[Add Name](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/index.html#add). Allows you add a new name to the backbone, but check if it is already in. It forces an acknowledgement if there is a homonym.
>[Stats](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/index.html#stats) tab generates a table of how name accepted taxa, synonyms, genera, species etc there are at the selected rank.
>[Users](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/index.html#users) tab lists who has signed up, a link to their ORCID profile and the groups they have been assigned to curate.
>[Activity](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/index.html#activity) tab shows you who last edited records in the backbone, at the moment its select by User, we may impliment by Family.
>Under the [Data tab](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/#data) you'll find snapshot of data in different formats to download.


# Navigation Tabs



# A-Z

Begin by typing the name you are looking for. Rhakhis will begin suggesting names with the 1st letter typed. Keep typing until you see the record you find the Name you require.

  

This method of searching for a name returns exact what you type. For example if you type _Poa annua_ it will return the records that begin with _Poa annua._ If you misspell the name _Poa annum_ it will return no results. If you are unsure of spellings please use [Matching](https://list.worldfloraonline.org/rhakhis/ui/index.html#match) as its returns "like" results.

  

If you are searching for an infraspecific name do not insert the rank as it will return no results. Search only the name parts, for example "_Poa annua supina"._ This will return results for both the variety and subspecies records of this name.

  

**Color Coding of Records**

  

Red records are **deprecated** \- these signify that they should not be used, but can be resurrected by Curators. These can be deprecated from a number of reasons including duplication, being linked to a suppressed IPNI record, fossil names, errors, or names outside the scope of the WFO.

  

Yellow are records **placed** within classification and can be accepted names or synonyms.

  

Grey are currently **unplaced** records. These are effectively a nomenclatural records with no taxonomic status.

  

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/bc855ede-0f01-45a5-b39c-b4d259756aab/image.png)

# Matching

Matching requires at least 4 characters to work. It will suggest more then just the exact string searched this is useful where you are unsure of the epithet ending.

  

Matching also works with ranks being part of the name. It will still suggest more than the exact hit.

  

_"Poa annua_ subsp. _supina"_ for example will return the subspecies record and the two variety records of this name.

# Browse

The Browse Tab opens at our root record which is called Code, referring to the _International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants._

  

From here you can navigate down through the hierarchy using the Box to the Right called "Phyla". This has the main "groups" that the WFO curate: Angiosperms: Bryophytes, Gymnosperms and Pteridophytes.

Once you have navigated down through the ranks to the record you wish to look at you can use the breadcrumb trail to jump back through the hierarchy without having to start over.

# Add Name

To add a new name enter the name parts, with no ranks.

  

Please see below for details about how to create specific ranks.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/387adbb3-404d-4e8b-98ea-cc4be8336bb9/image.png)

For a **Genus** only a one name part if required. For [example:](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) [_Poa_](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) [or](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) [_Rhododendron._](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are)

  

[For](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) [**Infrageneric**](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) [names: two parts are](example: Poa or Rhododendron.</p><p><br/></p><p>For Infrageneric names: two parts are) required. The **Genus** and the **infrageneric name**. Rhododendron Rhododendron

  

For a **species** name two parts are required. The **Genus** and the **epithet.**

_Poa annua, Rhododendron ponticum_

  

For an **infraspecific name** the **Genus**, the **species** **epithet** and **infraspecific epithet** are required.

_Poa annua annua, Rhododendron ponticum ponticum._

  

For **supra-generic ranks** (subfamily, subfamily, supertribe, tribe) these only require a one part name.

For example Ericoideae, Phyllodoceae, Rhodoreae.

  

You select the rank in the name record once it has been created.

  

Rhakhis will check if the name exists before allowing you to continue. It the name does not exist the Create button will become active and you can create the record.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/a4aade91-4077-4a29-8c97-1a659e09022f/image.png)

  

  

Rhakhis will also suggest name records that exist that might be the same thing.

  

If you add a name that is a 100% match on the name parts, then you must, click the checkboxes to acknowledge that you are about to add another homonym before the Create button becomes active.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/be3905c7-8421-4e4b-acc8-ee2c6e20ae72/image.png)

  

Once you have created your record please see Adding a new name ([https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/231yy-2308/1e4000a9e581250/231yy-2088](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/231yy-2308/1e4000a9e581250/231yy-2088)) for the required and desirable data needed for the record.

# Data

The data download tab allows users to export data in a number of formats.

  

If you think of others please, contact Roger Hyam.

# Basics

This is a name page. You will see navigation breadcrumbs that allow you move up and down the classification.

  

The is a record page for a Genus.

  

Grey elements in records are nomenclatural.

  

Yellow elements are classification..

  

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/fafbe4b9-27e5-4c78-8662-842e2c9a1da0/image.png)

  

**Unplaced Names. - Grey records**

  

To raise to accepted. 1st change the Nomenclatural status to accepted. This will allow you to raise to accepted.

  

Make synonym - does not require a nomenclatural status. If you do not know its status leave it as Unknown.

# Adding a new name

Once you have created a new name following the process in Add Name ([https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/231yy-2308/1e4000a9e581250/231yy-3610](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/231yy-2308/1e4000a9e581250/231yy-3610)), you will have a "grey" nomenclatural record for the name.

Essential data
--------------

  

### Rank

Please select the appropriate rank from the drop down. Rhakhis will default to Genus for a one part name, species for a two part name and a subspecies for a three part name.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/f13b0b55-2a96-4371-bb4f-c666ad74bee1/image.png)

  

### Nomenclatural Status

The default nomenclatural Status is **Unknown**. Please select what is correct. If you are unsure leave it as unknown.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/97d2b9ad-d3ae-4bec-9bcb-4a3e5bae63e4/image.png)




**conserved -** These names have been conserved for continued use to improved nomenclatural stability. See [https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/](https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/)

**deprecated -** It is unlikely you would use this when creating a new record. If you find a record you want to remove from the public release use this status. Please add a note to the record stating why it has been deprecated.

**illegitimate -** The only placement activity you can do with illegitimate is to make it a synonym.

**invalid -** a name not validly published. The only placement activity you can do with invalid is to make it a synonym.

**rejected -** Name rejected by the Nomenclature Committee of the ICBN. See the lists here

[https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/](https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/)

**sanctioned -** fungal name equivalent of conserved. Do not use for names in the WFO.

**superfluous -** The only placement activity you can do with unknown is make it a synonym.

**unknown -** default status. The only placement activity you can do with unknown is make it a synonym.

**valid** \- use this when you know a name meets the requirements set out in the Code. Only valid names can be placed in the classification as an accepted taxon.

  

We plan to bring in the Conserved and Rejected statuses through as a batch update this is still in the work plan of as April 2023.

### Author string

  

Should follow the Standard Form abbreviation.

Please refer to IPNI. [www.ipni.org](http://www.ipni.org/)

Using advanced search and the Author Tab.

  

**Examples**

  

>Wall. for Nathaniel Wallich

>B.Z.Duan for Bao Zhong Duan.

WFO is aiming for the **fullest authorship** for a name record so please include ex authors.

  

>(Wall.) Hook.f. & Benth. ex Cleghorn

>Steud. ex [A.Rich](A.Rich).

>A.Cunn. ex Benth.

  

We are looking for no spaces between author's initials and last name.

>B.Z.Duan not B. Z. Duan

  

If you find errors in IPNI please feed back authorship corrections directly to IPNI editors.



### Protologue information

  

Should follow the Standard Form abbreviation.

Please refer to IPNI. [www.ipni.org](http://www.ipni.org/)

Using advanced search and the Publications Tab.

  

Examples:

Edinburgh J. Bot. 51(2): 173 (1994).

Kew Bull. 46(1): 171 (1991).

Prodr. \[A. P. de Candolle\] 2: 467 (1825).

  

The publication's "micro" citation generally follows what is found in IPNI.

If you find errors in IPNI please feed back publication corrections directly to IPNI editors.

  

Please also add the Year.

  

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/75f2f464-090c-4430-9f2c-d46c033762b4/image.png)

###   

  

Other desirable data
--------------------

  

### Nomenclatural Reference

Rhakhis is not a reference manager and only stores links to references.

  

A link to IPNI is desirable as the WFO aim to have this link to the nomenclators, Tropicos for Bryophytes, IPNI for the other groups covered by the WFO.

  

The WFO take monthly updated from IPNI. If the added name is a newly published name, or an old name from the literature please inform IPNI and we will receive the IPNI ID from them in the future.

  

The work plan to improve usability of Rhakhis will bring in other pieces of nomenclatural data, such as Type Specimen links to external Herbarium catalogues, full references to the publication if it has a DOI etc.

# Unplaced Names

As an Editor you can only work with records linked to part of the classification you have been given permission to curate by the WFO council.

  

Unplaced names in the classification are free for any editor to update, correct, edit and claim as a part of their classification.

  

Any records that you think belong in your TEN but may currently be under a Family you cannot edit please contact the TEN manager (Alan Elliott).

# Adding References

The scope of Rhakhis is nomenclature and taxonomy. We are working to make it as complete and authoritative as possible. Progress would be slower if we also tried build a system for managing ancillary data and, for example, incorporated a full citation manager or specimen catalogue. Those functions are better performed by other systems elsewhere on the internet. Certain classes of data are therefore handled by _References_ to other systems. These can be presented as decorated links in user interfaces and documents or can be explored by software agents.

  

A Reference in Rhakhis consists of the following fields:

1.  **URI** - A unique HTTP(s) web reference to another system on the internet. This includes DOIs in there HTTP form.
2.  **Label** - The display text to present to the user. For a book this might be a human readable version of the citation.
3.  **Kind** - The type of reference the URI points to. This can be one of: Person, Literature, Specimen or Database.
4.  **Image URI (optional)** - A link to a thumbnail image that may be useful to decorate the link. e.g. A low resolution image of the specimen, portrait of the person or the title page of a PDF.

  

References are normalized, there can be only one instance of a reference with its unique URI within Rhakhis. Multiple names can link to each reference.

  

Names are associated with References through name\_references. These allow the relationship to have two properties:

1.  **Comment** - An explanation of how the reference applies specifically to this name. It could be something like "Holotype specimen" or "Only known mention of name" or "Author based on abbreviation in the authors string."
2.  **Placement Related** - A flag so indicate this reference is concerned with the taxonomic placement of the name rather than the nomenclatural status of the name. In the current interface reference links with this flag are presented in a yellow box called "Taxonomic Sources". Reference links without this flag appear in the gray box entitled "Nomenclatural References".

  

### What if I don't have a URI for my reference?

#### Database

If the database isn't available online then we can't link to it. If you have a heritage database that is unlikely to be made available online but can be stored in an archival way (e.g. CSV files not Microsoft Access) then you could consider submitting it to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for safe keeping. This will create a DOI for the dataset that you can then use as the link.

#### Literature

It is common to have a list of literature references with no URIs. Typically this is because they don't have DOIs because they are too old to have been given one. There are different approaches you could take:

1.  If the publication is in the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) you can link to it there. This can either be done using the BHL link or a DOI they have minted for their publications. There is a [BHL working group](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2021/05/persistent-identifier-working-group.html) on this.
2.  Check if the treatment is in [Plazi TreatmentBank](https://plazi.org/treatmentbank/) and engage with them in getting literature submitted if possible.
3.  Link to an entry in [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/) for the article or book. If one doesn't exist you can create it. Put the page information in the name\_reference comment if that is appropriate, e.g. the page in a book so you don't have to create a WikiData entry for every page.
4.  If you can't or don't want to create article level entries in [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/) you can link to the publication (e.g. The book or journal) entry and include the details of the volume, page and article title in the name\_reference comment.

We will work to come up with more detailed guidance on creating links to literature in the future.

#### Person

If the person is alive then you should use their [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) as the link. If they don't have one you could ask them to register. If they don't want to register then you can't link to them. As a human they have a right not to be involved.

If the person is historical (a.k.a. dead) then you can link to them in [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/), creating an entry if need be. Don't try and solve the problem of no ORCID by moving someone from the alive to historical. That wouldn't be ethical.

#### Specimens

We only provide the ability to cite specimens if they are available online as an entry in a catalogue or image. If you have an image of the specimen and it is unlikely to be put online by the holding institution then you might consider uploading it to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) where it will be given a DOI that you can cite. If you only have text you can add it to the comments on the name.

### Taxonomic Sources

Each branch of the taxonomy within Rhakhis is supported by some external source. We therefore aim to have a Reference in the Taxonomic Source section for each accepted name that links to the authority we use to assert that taxon exists and has those synonyms. Ideally this will be a single database reference and/or a single literature reference although this isn't currently enforced by the system. An analogy is the linking to external sources for statements of fact in Wikipedia. Sometimes this Reference may be at a higher level within the taxonomy than the current taxon e.g. a single Taxonomic Source for a whole genus or family.

### Nomenclatural References

All names should have nomenclatural references. Eventually they will all have links to the original place of publication but it is appropriate to include any reference here that would be useful for someone researching the nomenclatural aspects of this name. These might include links to the authors and type specimens or nomenclatural databases (e.g. [IPNI](https://www.ipni.org/)) that contain such information. It would be inappropriate to have links here to simple occurrences of the name such as in a flora or occurrence database like [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) unless these were the only known source of the name and would be useful to figure out the place of publication etc.

# Placement in the classification



# Placement of an accepted record

To place a record in the classification.

  

To place as an accepted taxon,

  

1) Change the Nomenclatural status to Valid.

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/8704f3ac-3942-4510-afa0-0141d84d6c35/image.png)

  

2). In the Placement box. Select Raise to accepted taxon within.

Rhakhis is suggest _Agapetes_ as it can only be accepted in this Genus.

![](https://t2197470.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2197470/818abc38-5ec0-4b67-a833-03bb8e02b9e8/image.png)

# Placing as a synonym



# Moving a synonym



# Untitled



# Adding a Basionym

# Curators

If you are part of a Taxonomic Expert Network you will be assigned as the curator of the taxon and this gives you rights to edit that taxon, any descendant taxa and any synonyms of those taxa.

Once you have been made the Curator for your Family you can edit everything it contains. You will also now have the ability to assign colleagues as curators to any point in the part of the back bone you are assigned.

Unplaced names are not controlled by this authorization mechanism. An unplaced name can be edited by any user who is an editor of any taxon, but once that name is placed within the taxonomic hierarchy it is controlled by the editors of the associated taxa and becomes "locked" into the consensus taxonomy.
