# WFO Zotero Library

We are developing a community library to raise awareness of new literature, and in the future new classificaiton, for Taxonomic Expert Networks. 

This is currently experimental to investigate the potential of using Zotero as a bibliography for the World Flora Online Plant List. It may grow or be deleted.

The Library is open for anyone to view. If you want membership to interact with the library as part of being a TEN or to contribute please use the link to join.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We seeded the library with literature with doi's extracted from IPNI for names published in 2024.

We are now building on this monthly as part of our IPNI to WFO workflow. 

For each record added to the WFO backbone from IPNI that has a DOI the literature record is added to library. It is also added to the TEN's inbox as a method of making things more findable. If we do not have a TEN it is added to the Taxonomic Literature folder for the appropriate each year. 

The idea is that a TEN will check periodically, review the literature and use the "remove from collection" once it has been seen. This acts as the literature has been actioned/reviewed/implimented and literature remain in the library for others.

We hope to expand to Flora's and claissificaiton treatments which will also be added to a TEN's inbox if appropriate.

### The Future

We will archive the Library in various output formats and add them to the WFO Plant List and data release. This will preserve the data if we or Zotero is no longer supported.
