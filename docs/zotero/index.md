# WFO Zotero Library

We are developing a community library to raise awareness of new literature, and in the future new classificaiton, for Taxonomic Expert Networks. 

This is currently experimental to investigate the potential of using Zotero as a bibliography for the World Flora Online Plant List. It may grow or be deleted.

The Library is open for anyone to view. If you want membership to interact with the library as part of being a TEN, or to contribute please use the link to join.

## Now 

During Febuary 2025 the library was seeded references names published in 20204, with doi's in the IPNI metadata.

As of March 2025 we are building the library monthly as part of our IPNI to WFO workflow. Every record added to IPNI in the previous month, with a doi, is added to the library.

For each record added library, we place it in the corresponding Taxonomic Expert Network's inbox or if we do not have a TEN it is added to the Taxonomic Literature folder for the appropriate each year. 

The idea is that a TEN will check periodically, review the literature. Once a TEN has actioned a reference we think it best to use the "remove from collection" functionality. This clears it from the TEN's inbox but keeps the record in the WFO library.

We hope to expand to Flora's and claissificaiton treatments in the future. These will be added to TEN inboxes like new name literature.

### The Future

From the June 2025 WFO Plant List and data relase onwards, we will archive the Library in several output formats (BibTeX, JSON, EndNote XML...) and add these to Zenodo Archive. This will preserve the data if we stop using this Library or if Zotero is no longer supported.
